# FranceJS website

#### My little contrib to that big community. Keep up the good job.


What I have done?

  - PNG 2  HTML  from @nfroidure design
  - rethink it a bit
  - make it responsive (2013 There is no way a website ain't got this feature!!)
  - tools: sas/compass, susy
  
  
  
 It's not perfect, there is still  stuffs To-Doâ€¦
 
 
 
 
 ps: Guys don't miss **FranceJS.in(Toulouse)**
